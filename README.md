First I need to remember how to simply make a 16 x 16 grid of squares/divs in CSS.
I will simply make 16 divs with a class of "tile" to test this
Not sure of the order these, but I'll need to make dynamic so the grid can change
how many squares it contains.

Should I decide on a fixed size of the container or the square?

Eventually I will need to attach an event listener to each square/div to change color
on :hover I believe.

Somehow i cannot even get basic CSS to work. I think I am either mentally tapped out or just crazy!
