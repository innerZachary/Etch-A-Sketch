First I need to remember how to simply make a 16 x 16 grid of squares/divs in CSS.
I will simply make 16 divs with a class of "tile" to test this
Not sure of the order these, but I'll need to make dynamic so the grid can change
how many squares it contains.

Should I decide on a fixed size of the container or the square?

Eventually I will need to attach an event listener to each square/div to change color
on :hover I believe.

Somehow i cannot even get basic CSS to work. I think I am either mentally tapped out or just crazy!

Deleted Everything. Hopefully that helps.

It did!

Okay, the major drawing functionality works correctly. I will call it quits for the night.
Definitely a lot of cool features to add and learn about here!

Still needs a button to reset.

RGB Randomizer

Eraser

Opaque to Marie

Generally improve appearance with Ayana's help.

Got the reset button working correctly.

Added RGB and RGBA randomizer.

Control on number selector.

Still want to add:
  Eraser
  Maybe a slider to select the size rather than a prompt?
  Opaque hidden picture mode.
  Improved appearance
